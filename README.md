# MusicTracksAndProjects
Archive of WIP or completed music tracks

These tracks/compositions are free for use in hobby projects. I am very much not a professional composer or sound engineer, regardless, I'm glad if you find these useful/entertaining.

-The chiptune music is in FamiStudio: https://famistudio.org/
-The more "Normal" music is using LMMS: https://lmms.io/
-Older things would have been made using things like the eJay programs.

I intend to move all of my older musical experiments here as an archive too although I no longer have the projects files for them...

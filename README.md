# MusicTracksAndProjects
Archive of WIP or completed music tracks

These tracks/compositions are free for use in hobby projects. I am very much not a professional composer or sound engineer, regardless, I'm glad if you find these useful/entertaining.

The chiptune music is in FamiStudio: https://famistudio.org/

I intend to move all of my older musical experiments here as an archive too although I no longer hve the projects files for them..
